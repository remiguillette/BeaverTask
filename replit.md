## How to Use

### Adding a Task

2. Type your task in the input field at the bottom of the details panel
3. Press Enter to create the task

### Managing Tasks
- **Select a Date**: Click any date in the calendar to view tasks for that day

- **Delete a Task**: Click the × button on any task to delete it
- **Navigate Months**: Use the left/right arrow buttons to move between months
- **Go to Today**: Click the search icon to jump back to today's date

- **Completed**: Task is marked as complete
- **Overdue**: Task is not complete and due date has passed
- **Pending**: Task is not complete and due date is today or in the future

All tasks are stored in your browser's localStorage under the key `beavertask_tasks`. Data persists between sessions but is specific to each browser/device.
